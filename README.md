- 👋 Hi, I’m @fishscriptkiddie
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a little bit of Python but I want to get better. I like hacking stuff (like my 3ds) but am also not good at it. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I'm not sure!
- 📫 How to reach me ... idk!
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I really like tamagotchis! I'm curious as to how they are made.
